### printf

General usage is `printf("argument_string", argument_list)` 

Java has `System.out.printf()` too



- Print 2 columns with 15 character spacing b/w them. First column is string and second column is 3 digit int with padding

  ```java
  System.out.printf("%-15s%03d%n", left, right);	
  ```
